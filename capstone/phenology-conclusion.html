		<p>As you saw, the grasshoppers do not grow as fast in a cool year compared to a warm one. On average, the population does reach stage 6, meaning not all of the individual grasshoppers reach adulthood. However, in a warm year, they all reach adulthood early in the season.</p>

		<p>When it comes to climate change, as the climate warms, grasshoppers will be growing up faster than they did in the past. They will hatch, grow, reporduce, and die sooner in the calendar year than before. This will have major implications for both the plants the grasshoppers eat, and the animals that eat the grasshoppers.</p>
