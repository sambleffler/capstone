		<p>As you saw, temperature and elevation both affect a grasshopper's ability to hop. The warm adapted speices in the example performed best at high temperatures and lowever elevations. If that was a cool adapted grasshopper, it would behave in the opposite way, while a generalist would have done well in a broad range of temperatures and elevations.</p>

		<p>Now consider how climate change would affect these different species. Perhaps a warm adapted grasshopper would be able to perfom better at a higher elevation if the temperature was even warmer, while a cool adapted grasshopper would not. Climate change does not affect all species equally; some will benefit while others will suffer. This is no only true for grasshoppers. Many species across the evelation gradient are adapted for certain temperature ranges and will feel the effects of climate change differently.</p>
