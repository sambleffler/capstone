		<p>As you saw, accidental prarie grasshoppers occur across elevations throughout the season. However, they are most common in the hottest part of the summer. This is when the grasshoppers from the warm prarie are best able to survive at higher elevations. The researchers also found that wind speeds played a significant role in allowing the prarie speices to relocate.</p>

		<p>This matters because as the climate changes, these prarie spieces will be more able to move up in elevations. Though they have not yet begun to live permanantly at higher elevations, it's certainly possible in the near future.</p>
